# test
How to execute the program?
----------------------------
Execute the included JAR file 'CalculateDriverScore.jar' and provide the data file name as Input Argument. 
If no argument is given, the programs will ask to manually enter the data file name.
If the data file is in same location as the JAR file, just file name is enough. Otherwise please give full path including the file name.
The output will be printed in the console. It is also captured in a list of Report objects for future reporting.

How the project is structured?
-------------------------------
IT is structured as a Java Main class program. The 'CalculateDriverScore.java' class does all the processing.
Domain objects are created to capture data for Driver, Trip, and Report objects.

The basic tests are implemented in 'CalculateDriverScoreTest.java' class.

Run in own machine
------------------
Import/open the project in your IDE. This is a netbeans project, so you may want to convert it to your IDE specific if required.
You can  debug the program from 'CalculateDriverScore.java' class.
